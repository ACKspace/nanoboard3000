# Altium NanoBoard 3000 - Xilinx version
The NanoBoard 3000 is a beautiful FPGA development board designed by Altium.
Originally designed to be programmed in Altium Designer itself, support was unfortunately dropped.
This project attempts to get the NanoBoard 3000 up and running again in Xilinx ISE.

Documentation and files needed to do so will end up on this repo.
If time and interest allows I will also seek to provide code examples for the different peripherals.
